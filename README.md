# Simulation of an Intrusion Detection System using Federated Learning

This repo is largly influenced by the works [Yann Busnel and LÃ©o Lavaur](https://github.com/phdcybersec/nof_2023/tree/main).

For now, we use UNSW-NB15 dataset in the folder `./dataset/UNSW-B15` available [here](https://research.unsw.edu.au/projects/unsw-nb15-dataset).

This repo is still under development.
